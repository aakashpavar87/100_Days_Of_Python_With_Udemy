#Hint 4: Create a deal_card() function that uses the List below to *return* a random card.
#11 is the Ace.
#cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
def deal_with_card():
    '''This Function Returns a Random card From the Deck'''
    cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]
    return random.choice(cards)
#Hint 6: Create a function called calculate_score() that takes a List of cards as input 
#and returns the score. 
#Look up the sum() function to help you do this.
def calculate_score(cards):
    #Hint 7: Inside calculate_score() check for a blackjack (a hand with only 2 cards: ace + 10) and return 0 instead of the actual score. 0 will represent a blackjack in our game.
    if sum(cards) == 21 and len(cards) == 2:
        return 0
    # Hint 8: Inside calculate_score() check for an 11 (ace). If the score is already over 21, remove the 11 and replace it with a 1. You might need to look up append() and remove().
    if sum(cards) > 21 and 11 in cards:
        cards.remove(11)
        cards.append(1)
    return sum(cards)

#Hint 13: Create a function called compare() and pass in the user_score and computer_score. If the computer and user both have the same score, then it's a draw. If the computer has a blackjack (0), then the user loses. If the user has a blackjack (0), then the user wins. If the user_score is over 21, then the user loses. If the computer_score is over 21, then the computer loses. If none of the above, then the player with the highest score wins.

def compare(user_score,computer_score):
    if user_score == computer_score:
        return "It's a Draw ðŸ˜‰"
    elif user_score == 0:
        return "You win with Black Jack ðŸ˜Ž"
    elif computer_score == 0:
        return "Opponent win with Black Jack ðŸ˜±"
    elif user_score > 21:
        return "You went over 21 ðŸ˜¥"
    elif computer_score > 21:
        return "Oppenent went over 21 . You win ðŸ¤—"
    elif user_score > computer_score:
        return "Yeh you have win the game ðŸ¤©"
    else:
        return "Computer has won ðŸ‘€"
    
#Hint 11: The score will need to be rechecked with every new card drawn and the checks in Hint 9 need to be repeated until the game ends.
